# front-end-obfuscator
### Things to look into
#### CSS
+ Create array with all bootstrap library and check it as to not obfuscate that part
+ Make sure characters generated are only letters and numbers
#### PHP
+ Create array with all bootstrap library and check it as to not obfuscate that part
+ Make sure characters generated are only letters and numbers
#### JS
+ Make sure all class names are caught
+ Make sure nothing else is caught, I have seen things like ".(functionname" be considered a classname
